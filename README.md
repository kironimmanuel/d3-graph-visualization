# Undirected Graph Implementation and Visualization

Using [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) and [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) for the rendering and physics simulation.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Graphs

Uncomment the script tag for the graph you want to see in `index.html` (only one at a time):

```html
<script src="./dist/unweighted-graph.js"></script>
<!-- <script src="./dist/weighted-graph.js"></script> -->
```
